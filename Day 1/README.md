<b>Task</b><br>
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i,d,s and are already declared and initialized for you. You must:
<ol type="1">
<li>Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.</li>
<li>Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.</li>
<li>Use the + operator to perform the following operations:</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.</li>
<li>Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.</li>
<li>Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.</li>
</ol></ol><br>

<b>Input Format</b>

The first line contains an integer that you must sum with i.<br>
The second line contains a double that you must sum with d.<br>
The third line contains a string that you must concatenate with s.<br><br>

<b>Output Format</b><br>
Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles (scaled to 1 decimal place) on the second line, and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.
